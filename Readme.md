- Download the folder problem_statement_1_and_2 provided here in the repo with all the files mentioned in the code in the notebook.
- Make sure to unzip the files so that the file structure is maintained.
- Upload the files to the Google Drive or to the files section in colab notebook and change the path accordingly wherever necessary

1. Run the GRIHAMC-ReportGen.ipynb first
2. classification_report.json is generated.

4. JSON file and CSV files are created.
5. Run the next cells in GRIHAMC_Front_end.ipynb for segregating the grievances, now classified based on org into stages.
