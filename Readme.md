All data are utilised as per the dataset provided for the competition. Some data are converted in various format for ease of access and is provided here.

Kindly contact me in email: smeenakshi1997@gmail.com for any clarification

Flow of the system:

- Download the folder problem_statement_1_and_2 provided here in the repo with all the files mentioned in the code in the notebook.
- Make sure to unzip the files so that the file structure is maintained.
- Upload the files to the Google Drive or to the files section in colab notebook and change the path accordingly wherever necessary

1. Run the GRIHAMC-ReportGen.ipynb.
2. classification_report.json is generated. For utilising translation code, use the designated cell in colab and continue the generation of output in the following cells. 
3. Upload it in the files section of GRIHAMC_Front_end.ipynb and run the cells continuously or download streamlit and run app.py. Use the visualization tool for generating specific reports.
4. JSON file and CSV files are created.
5. Run the next cells in GRIHAMC_Front_end.ipynb for segregating the grievances, now classified based on org into stages.

- Training code can be run as such with the files in problem_statement_1_and_2

- Run app.py file after downloading streamlit using installation given in Front end code, if necessary.

- The output files and training dataset created are also provided in the folder to understand the system better.

- The presentation and pdf files provide information on the project

All the codes and modules were developed completely by me, and are original. All open source tools are utilised as per open source licenses.
