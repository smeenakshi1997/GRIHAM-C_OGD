I would like to lodge a complaint against the Kolkata customs department for their unprofessional behaviour. My personal parcel arriving from Saudi Arabia was held at the Kolkata customs department and levied a fifty sum of 30000, the reasons for which are clearly unknown. No form of communication is possible with them as they never pick up phone calls, reply to the emails, respond to tweets.\r\n\r\nThe package is worth 300 saudi riyals and contains dates, chocolates, atta and biscuits weighing 30 kgs. I still don&#39;t get why a package containing food items will be contained for 2 months without any clarification. Even if there were any issues , we were to be informed but that didn&#39;t happen unfortunately.\r\n\r\n2 months is enough for perishable items to rot in the box, the condition in which they will be lying is also not hard to guess. For this inconvenience I would like to ask for an remuneration of equal amount in INR which is approximately 6,582 rupee. I understand the hustle bustle of a government department but that in no way means that a case should go unattended. \r\n\r\nOne more thing - the numbers available on the official page to contact kolkata customs department are either invalid or never received by anyone.\r\n\r\nconsignment number: X-X-X-X-X",
